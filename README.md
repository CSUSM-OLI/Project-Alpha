# PROJECT-ALPHA

In order to learn more about Git and open source the Open Lab Initiative(OLI) at Cal State San Marcos proposes Project-Alpha

## What is Project-Alpha?
Starting out it will be a website that has announcements for OLI, lists different tools and resources engineering students can utilize. The hope is that the project will grow into something more as time goes on and will be a constant learning tool for students.

## Hacktoberfest
The idea for Project-Alpha was born out of wanting to participate in Hacktoberfest 2020 and become more familiar with Git and open source.
